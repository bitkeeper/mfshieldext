For the Arduino IDE there is library available at https://www.cohesivecomputing.co.uk/hackatronics/arduino-multi-function-shield/.
You can also find a nice pdf manual for the use of it. This extension is based on version 1.2 of the multi-function-shield library.

An example project that demonstrates the use of most block is provided at https://ide.mblock.cc/#/?cloudProjectId=161721.
